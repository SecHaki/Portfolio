# 👋-Welcome to My Portfolio! 

## About Me  
I’m a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience supporting enterprise SOC operations for a large public-sector organization. I work daily with SIEM, EDR, and network security tools to detect threats, analyze phishing campaigns, correlate indicators of compromise, and support incident response across thousands of endpoints and users.

My background combines formal cybersecurity education with real-world defensive operations, including threat hunting, log analysis, security automation, and endpoint hardening aligned with CIS and CJIS standards. I enjoy turning raw security data into actionable insights—whether that’s through Splunk dashboards, PowerShell automation, or improving detection and response workflows.

I’m actively building and documenting projects in my GitHub portfolio to demonstrate practical security skills, continuous learning, and a strong blue-team mindset, with a focus on SOC operations, incident response, and cyber defense.
